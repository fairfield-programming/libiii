This library is made to be simple to use and integrate into modern apps. Because of this, we designed the library to be very high-level. But, we still allow anyone to access the lower level functions."

Since the format itself is so complex and modular, we do encourage usage of this library, as it always stays up to date with the format."

To keep the ports high quality and up to date, please have them depend on this repository in some kind of way.

We have found that code with comments has a much higher chance of being integrated into the project. On top of this, the most performant code is usually using the simplest solution. So, we do ask that you avoid overly complex performance optimizations (though we do judge them on a case by case basis, so do ask)."
