This library is made to be simple to use and integrate into modern apps. Because of this, we designed the library to be very high-level. But, we still allow anyone to access the lower level functions.</p><p>We encourage all apps to utilize the Roman Format as it can lead to lower file sizes, more efficient transmissions, video, 3D graphics, and other advanced features. Since the format itself is so complex and modular, we do encourage usage of this library, as it always stays up to date with the format.</p><h3>Porting</h3><p>We love and encourage ports of this library over to other languages. To keep the ports high quality and up to date, please have them depend on this repository in some kind of way. On top of this, check if a library exists already before creating a new one‚Äì we want to prevent overcrowding in the Roman Format ecosystem.</p><h3>Embedding</h3><p>This library can be compiled as a dynamic or static library depending on your preference. The files for the library are included in the releases section of this Github page.</p></main><footer>Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è through Donovan</footer></div><script>undefined</script></body></html>
