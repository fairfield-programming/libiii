We have found that code with comments has a much higher chance of being integrated into the project. On top of this, the most performant code is usually using the simplest solution. So, we do ask that you avoid overly complex performance optimizations (though we do judge them on a case by case basis, so do ask).</p></main><footer>Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è through Donovan</footer></div><script>undefined</script></body></html>
